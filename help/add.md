# Add a systemmate

In any channel the bot is in, type the command, systemmate name, and image link:

```
${PREFIX}add Nicole https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/201841370023985153/6879455d380aeb5bd9ee87c02f873e99.png
```
to add for example a systemmate named `Nicole` with this avatar: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/201841370023985153/6879455d380aeb5bd9ee87c02f873e99.png> and standard Nameslash proxying.

Optionally, you can define proxy tags for systemmates on addition, by typing out what your systemmate saying `text` would look like, right after the image link:

```
${PREFIX}add Nicole https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/201841370023985153/6879455d380aeb5bd9ee87c02f873e99.png [text]
${PREFIX}add Jessie https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/432387574494134284/449061645210091520/image.png {text
${PREFIX}add Ashe https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/432387574494134284/449124880319905792/image.png Ashe\ text
```

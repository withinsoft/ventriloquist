# Changing proxy method

In any channel the bot is in:

```
${PREFIX}chproxy name proxy_settings
${PREFIX}chproxy Nicole [text]
```

and the proxying settings will be immediately updated.

Please see `${PREFIX}help proxy` for more information on available proxy methods.
Please see `${PREFIX}help list` for more information listing systemmates and proxy methods. 

Here are some examples:

```
${PREFIX}chproxy Diana [text]
${PREFIX}chproxy Diana Diana\ text
${PREFIX}chproxy Diana D\ text
```
